        This css file should be used when there 
        are situations in which the browser decided 
        to add its own styles to the tags on your site, 
        but you tried so hard on them, helloooo. Like, 
        I'm literally writing this text in a paragraph 
        but this css file completely erased it (woah magic, right?).
        And it erased almost most styles for the common tags.
        Bro, you gotta write aaaall styles by yourself. To put it simply, 
        in normalize.css (my frienemy) you have basic styles 
        to fit in with other sites. But I'm not like my frienemy. 
        You have to start from the beginning with me. So write ALL of your styles yourself.
        You will thank me later, when that dumb browser 
        tries to change any of your styles and I won't let him.

        On this page you can see this text, which 
        has been modified by a normalize.css file. Nothing 
        special, just that this css file will help 
        ensure cross-browser compatibility and 
        normalize the display of HTML elements 
        on different platforms. For example, as 
        you may have noticed, the margin is literally 
        zero. So yeaaah, it's hard to read and really annoying. 
        If you want margins, go and do it yourself.
        There are also a couple (a lot) of tags I know nothing 
        about, but the css file is working juuust fine, trust me!!!
        Aaaand this css file only targets the tags that need 
        to be normalized (it literally said i can fix him (them)) 
        so some tags are not affected (duh, obviously).
